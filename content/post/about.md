I am walker, writer, coder, reader, and father of three kids. I specialize in building secure, scalable, and reliable systems. I am currently a Principal Solutions Architect at AWS where I focus on Blockchain, web3, Kubernetes, Service Meshes, microservices, and containers. All opinions are my own.

I was born in India and I moved to the US in my 20s. I studied linguistics and philosophy at Delhi University. I have been a Software Developer/Engineer for about 18 years. My current interests are software, psychology, and classical and contemporary literature.

I write on diverse subjects including software and infrastructure, and psychology and philosophy.
